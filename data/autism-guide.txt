Note on "Spelling" Methods (S2C/RPM)

Spelling to Communicate (S2C) and Rapid Prompting Method (RPM), often promoted
through TikTok/Instagram as "unlocking" hidden intelligence via letterboards, belong in
Table 4 (High Risk) despite low cost, due to opportunity cost and authorship concerns.

●​ The Issue: Research indicates messages may originate from facilitator

(ideomotor/automatic movements), not the child—similar to debunked Facilitated
Communication (FC).
●​ The Risk: False hope, educational neglect (not teaching actual functional
communication), allegations of abuse based on false typed allegations, diversion
from AAC systems that preserve autonomy.
●​ Evidence: No controlled studies validate independent authorship; multiple cases
of facilitators inadvertently guiding responses.
Alternative: Focus on independent AAC systems (eye-gaze tech, independent typing
with fading prompts photographed from behind) where authorship can be validated.
also include a comprehensive set of testing that should be requested from medical
professionals and companies where those tests can be procured with or without

Sample Diagnostic Script for Your First Genetics Visit
"We want a comprehensive workup to guide treatment. Specifically, we're requesting:

1.​ Chromosomal microarray and Fragile X (standard)
2.​ Whole exome sequencing trio if microarray negative
3.​ Mitochondrial DNA and nuclear mitochondrial panel given low tone/fatigue/folate

response
4.​ FRAT testing for folate receptor antibodies (we'll pay out of pocket if denied)
5.​ Targeted metabolic panel including plasma amino acids, acylcarnitine,
pyruvate/lactate
6.​ Thyroid panel with antibodies, B12, homocysteine, MMA

We also want to rule out autoimmune/encephalitic processes given language regression
concerns [if applicable] - would you order the Cunningham Panel or refer to immunology?"

Next steps: Bring this list to your geneticist, but let them guide prioritization based on
your child's specific phenotype (dysmorphic features? growth charts? seizure history?).
The geneticist will also discuss "secondary findings" — unrelated cancer/heart risks that
may be found incidentally on exome sequencing. You can opt out of receiving these if
preferred.
